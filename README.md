# Supplier Recommender POC

##  Project Description
This is a Proof-of-Concept application that recommends the top 3 eligible suppliers for a given item and quantity using Machine Learning (XGBoost) and a simple Tkinter GUI.  
It simulates supplier and historical RFQ data to train the model and recommends based on normalized features like Price, Reliability, Quality, and Compliance.

---

##  Features
- Supplier simulation (50 suppliers).
- Historical RFQ data generation (5000 samples).
- Machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict supplier suitability.
- Simple GUI using Tkinter for interactive supplier recommendations.
- Top 3 supplier suggestions displayed in a table.
